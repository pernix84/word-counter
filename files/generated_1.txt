The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog This is a simple test file with normal lines
Each line contains a reasonable number of words that any text processing system should handle easily

Testing various scenarios:
Multiple words on single lines
Empty lines between paragraphs
Different punctuation marks: commas periods semicolons and dashes

The quick brown fox appears again to test duplicate word counting
Some lines are shorter
Some lines are much longer with many more words to process and count accurately in the system

Special cases: words and hyphenated-words should be handled correctly
Numbers like 123 and 456 might appear in the text
    Indented lines with leading spaces
		Lines with tabs and mixed whitespace

Repeated words: the the the quick quick quick brown brown brown
End of file approaching with common words: and the in of to a is are were was
